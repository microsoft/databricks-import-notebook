# Databricks Import Directory Action

GitHub Action that imports the files from a local path into a Databricks workspace. [![Build](https://github.com/microsoft/databricks-import-notebook/actions/workflows/cd.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/microsoft/databricks-import-notebook/actions/workflows/cd.yml)

## When to use

This action is useful when you need to import a directory to the Databricks workspace, for example, when you want to import notebooks into a specific path.
Only directories and files with the extensions .scala, .py, .sql, .r, .R, .ipynb are imported. 

## How it works

The GitHub Action works with the 'import_dir' command from the Databricks Workspace Cli

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Make sure you have a directory in your repo you want to import into Databricks
* Make sure you have installed the [Databricks Cli](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/install-databricks-cli)
* Make sure you have a Databricks Access Token. It can be a [PAT](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/authentication.html), or if you're working with Azure Databricks, it can be an [AAD Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/api/latest/aad/service-prin-aad-token).

>Note: You can find both sample workflows in this repository.
